# Twig Explorer

This is a spike to see how hard it would be to make a "Twig Explorer". It isn't hard - at all.

Written in typescript because that is easier to spike in. Probably would have to have the easeljs or fabricjs package and neither of them do a great job with typescript so the final product would probably have to be javascript if you want cool things like transisions and non-hacky mouse detection. Also this is mostly functional which is probably not worth doing.

Doesn't pull twiglets dynamically, just loads one from JSON (Emails) because this a proof of concept.

Go explore! Though in practice, this feels kind of useless to me.
